// MTL5 -- accumulator policy for inner-product accumulation (issue #158)
//
// A single, cross-cutting customization point for how an inner product (a dot
// product, the columns of an LU, a GEMM element) is accumulated. It lets the
// THREE precisions of a mixed-precision tensor op be chosen independently:
//
//   * Value  -- the element/storage precision of the operands (bandwidth in)
//   * Acc    -- the accumulator precision the products are summed in (registers)
//   * Result -- the precision the rounded result is delivered/stored in (out)
//
// The trait abstracts a sum-of-products reduction behind clear/assign/
// add_product/value, so a kernel writes the same loop regardless of HOW the
// terms are combined. Three reduction configurations are expressible:
//
//   1. Plain accumulate (acc += product) -- the DEFAULT primary template.
//      The product `m*v` is formed in the accumulator precision `Acc`, rounded,
//      then added: two rounding events per term. Zero overhead and byte-
//      identical to hand-written arithmetic when `Acc == Value`; a wider `Acc`
//      than `Value` (e.g. fp32 accumulate over bf16 elements) gains accuracy
//      out of the box. Use any arithmetic type as `Acc` (e.g. `float`,`double`).
//
//   2. Fused multiply-add (acc = fma(m, v, acc)) -- `fma_accumulator<T>`.
//      The product is never rounded: `m*v + acc` is formed as if in infinite
//      precision and rounded ONCE to `T` per term. One rounding event per term
//      instead of two. The fused step is `using std::fma; fma(...)`, so `T` may
//      be a built-in float or any custom arithmetic type with an ADL-found `fma`.
//
//   3. Super-accumulator (exact sum of products, single final round-out).
//      A caller supplies a custom `Acc` (a compensated/Kahan accumulator, or a
//      Universal `quire` exact dot product) by specializing
//      `accumulator_traits<Acc, Value>`. MTL5 stays free of any external number
//      library, so the quire super-accumulator itself lives in the peer repo
//      that pairs MTL5 with Universal; this header only defines the contract it
//      plugs into. `value<Result>` then rounds the exact accumulator out once.
//
// Used by the sparse factorizations and the dense BLAS-level operations.
//
// WORKSPACE COST (#342). Several accumulator-aware kernels allocate a
// std::vector<Acc> whose length scales with the problem, not with a register.
// Measured peak live accumulators on a 2-D Laplacian, so this is the real
// scaling of these kernels rather than an estimate:
//
//     kernel             n=400   n=1600   n=6400   peak/n
//     sparse_lu            400     1600     6400   1.00
//     supernodal_ldlt      489     3073     9558   1.22 - 1.92
//
// i.e. Theta(n), and up to ~2n for the supernodal dense panel, whose exact
// multiplier tracks supernode structure and so is matrix-dependent.
// supernodal_lu and the transposed SpMV in operation/mult.hpp have the same
// shape.
//
// That is free for configurations 1 and 2 -- both are the size of the value
// type -- but a configuration-3 super-accumulator is sized to the value type's
// complete dynamic range plus carry-guard bits, so it is one to two orders of
// magnitude larger per element. At n = 1e6 a workspace that costs 8 MB with a
// double costs on the order of 64 MB with a posit32 quire and ~536 MB with a
// binary64 Kulisch accumulator, before the supernodal multiplier.
//
// POLICY: the kernels are NOT restructured for this. A caller choosing an
// exact accumulator is choosing a workspace proportional to sizeof(Acc), and
// the capacity/guard bits of that accumulator are the lever -- a quire sized
// for a shorter reduction is correspondingly smaller. Revisit with measurements
// once a quire specialization exists to measure; restructuring these inner
// loops for a type that cannot yet be instantiated would be speculative, and
// the alternatives are not free either (blocking trades passes for memory;
// splitting the accumulation weakens the single-rounding guarantee that is the
// entire point of configuration 3).
//
// tests/unit/sparse/test_accumulator_workspace.cpp pins the scaling above, so a
// change that made a workspace superlinear fails rather than silently shipping.
